Business Formation Statistics (BFS) are a standard data product of the U.S. Census Bureau developed in research collaboration with economists affiliated with Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, University of Maryland, and University of Notre Dame. BFS provide timely and high frequency information on new business applications and formations in the United States.

## info
- Business Formation Statistics will be provided monthly at the national, regional, and state levels.
- BFS data cover Employer Identification Number (EIN) applications made in the United States, including those associated with starting a new employer business.
- The Monthly BFS data cover the period starting from July 2004 at a monthly frequency. Monthly BFS data are released approximately 11-12 days after the end of the observed month.
- The Business Formation Series, available only on a monthly basis, measures new employer firm births, the point when an application is realized and a business begins to operate.
- The Business Dynamic Statistics [BDS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/bds.html) program of the Census Bureau also provides information on new employer businesses at annual frequency. However, there are some key differences in how BDS and BFS account for new business formation.
